# B-Plus-Plus/B++ (Programming Language)

> Will be release in 20??

## Introduction
Now I'm really into it so I made a next version of B# and it's called B++ (B++'s interpreter is written in B# and B).  
The B++ is quite similar to B# and B but ***it's more powerful***.  

***B++ scripts have the file extension of .bpp, .bpx, .bxx, .b++, .hb, .hbp, .hbpp, .hbx, .hbxx, and .hb++.***  
***This programming language will support graphics.***  

<!---
This programming language will cooperate as a programming language and will support some programming language as a support language. If you are willing to wait then you will see how powerful this programming language in 2029!.
The B language will be written in C++, The B# language will be written in B, and B++ language will be written in B and B#. Thank you. :)
